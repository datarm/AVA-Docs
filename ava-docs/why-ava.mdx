# Why Choose AVA?

## AI That Works™, Not Just Talks

Most AI assistants just answer questions. **AVA takes action.**

AVA completes real work in your Microsoft 365 environment—scheduling meetings, creating tasks, sharing files, generating presentations, and orchestrating complex workflows across your business systems. It's the difference between an AI chatbot and an AI super assistant.

## The AVA Advantage

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Runs in Your Azure Tenant">
    **Your data never leaves your environment**

    AVA is deployed as an Enterprise Application within your own Azure tenant. Unlike SaaS AI tools that send your data to external clouds, AVA processes everything within your infrastructure.

    **Benefits:**
    - Complete data sovereignty and control
    - Meet strict compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)
    - No third-party data exposure
    - Audit trail stays in your tenant
    - Aligns with existing Azure governance

    Your IT team controls deployment, updates, and access—not an external vendor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identity-Based Security">
    **Delegated permissions—AVA accesses only what you can access**

    AVA uses Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for authentication. It operates with **your delegated permissions**, not elevated admin privileges.

    **What this means:**
    - If you can't access a file in SharePoint, neither can AVA on your behalf
    - No "shadow RBAC" or separate permission systems to manage
    - Every action is logged with your identity
    - Conditional Access policies apply to AVA
    - MFA and security policies are enforced

    **Unlike other AI tools:**
    - Many AI platforms require admin-level API keys that can access *everything*
    - AVA never has broader access than the user—it's fundamentally more secure
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No Separate Agents Required">
    **One conversation, all your data sources**

    Unlike other AI platforms where you must create and configure separate agents for each integration (one for Salesforce, another for Jira, another for email), AVA seamlessly orchestrates across all your connected data sources in a single conversation.

    **Example:**
    ```
    You: @Salesforce show opportunities closing this quarter
    AVA: [Returns Salesforce data]

    You: For each opportunity, check @Jira for blocking issues
    AVA: [Automatically combines Salesforce + Jira data]

    You: Email the report to my team
    AVA: [Generates report and drafts email via Outlook]
    ```

    **One AI assistant, zero configuration required.** Just use @ mentions and AVA handles the complexity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Seamless Microsoft 365 Integration">
    **Native integration with your entire Microsoft ecosystem**

    AVA leverages Microsoft Graph API for deep integration:

    **Outlook:**
    - Read and send emails
    - Schedule meetings with availability checking
    - Access calendar events
    - Manage inbox with AI assistance

    **Teams:**
    - Access meeting transcripts
    - Search channel messages
    - Create Teams meetings
    - Summarize conversations

    **OneDrive & SharePoint:**
    - Search across all your files
    - View and edit documents in AVA
    - Share files with proper permissions
    - Create folders and organize content

    **To Do:**
    - Create and manage tasks
    - Set due dates and reminders
    - Organize with lists
    - Track completion

    **And more:**
    - Planner integration
    - Power BI data access
    - Microsoft Security (Defender)
    - All via unified @Microsoft 365 Apps mention
