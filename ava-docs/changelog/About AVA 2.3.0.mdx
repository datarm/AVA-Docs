# Release Notes for AVA Update 2.3.0

Welcome to AVA 2.3.0! This release introduces a handful of small, but mighty updates to improve your experience with AVA.

- **Exporting to PowerPoint:** Users can now export content from chats or the Notes tab in the Workspace to PowerPoint. AVA will intelligently convert your text content into slides, complete with a title slide and a slide for each section of content. You can even choose from uploaded templates to customize the appearance of your presentation.
- **Small Prompt Library:** We've updated a small Prompts button that appears above the chat box when you add a spreadsheet or meeting transcript to a chat. We've also given you some quick options to get you relevant prompts for file handling faster.
- **Updates to Fetching Online Meetings:** Some users were experiencing issues fetching online meetings. We've improved that by paginating your meetings. This helps get you to your recent meetings faster, and you can click the new "load more" button to download the next set of meetings.
- **Improved App Performance:** Thanks to a freak accident involving a lightning strike and chemicals in our laboratory, AVA is now significantly faster and more performant. We hope you like the new speed.

These updates are designed to make your AVA experience more streamlined, efficient, and enjoyable. We hope you enjoy them!
