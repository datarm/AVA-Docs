## What is AVA?

### AI That Works™

**AVA (AI Virtual Assistant)** is an enterprise-grade AI assistant that runs securely within your Azure tenant. Unlike traditional SaaS AI tools that just answer questions, AVA *takes action*—scheduling your meetings, sharing your documents, creating tasks, and generating presentations. It integrates directly with your Microsoft 365 environment and business systems through Microsoft Graph API, using your existing identity and permissions to be your AI super assistant.

<Info>
  **AI That Works, Not Just Talks**: AVA doesn't just chat—it completes real work in your Microsoft 365 environment. Schedule meetings, create tasks, share files, generate presentations, and more.
