</Tabs>

### Understanding @ Mentions

The `@` symbol is how you access connected data sources:

- **@Web** - Real-time web searches for current information
- **@Salesforce** - CRM data (if configured)
- **@Jira** - Issues and projects (if configured)
- **@GitHub** - Repositories and code (if configured)
- **@NetSuite** - Business records (if configured)

<Tip>
  Start typing `@` and AVA will show you all available data sources!
</Tip>

## Step 3: Try the Workspace

The Workspace panel on the right has three tabs. Let's explore them:

### Search Tab

1. Click **"Search"** tab in workspace
2. Select **"Microsoft Files"**
3. Search for a document (try "meeting notes")
4. Click a file to preview it
5. Click **"Add to Conversation"** button

Now ask AVA: **"Summarize the key points from this document"**

<Check>
  AVA reads the document and provides a summary!
</Check>

### Notes Tab

1. Click **"Notes"** tab
2. Type some notes:
   ```
   # My First AVA Session

   Today I learned:
   - How to use @ mentions
   - How to search for files
   - How to add files to conversations
   ```
3. Use the formatting toolbar to style your notes
4. Notes are automatically saved

<Tip>
  You can export notes to PowerPoint! Try adding more content and clicking **"Export to PowerPoint"**
</Tip>

### File Viewer Tab

1. Ask AVA: **"@Microsoft 365 Apps find the employee handbook"**
2. When AVA returns results, click a file
3. File opens in **File Viewer** tab
4. Toggle between **View** and **Edit** modes
5. Make changes if needed (saves automatically to SharePoint)

## Step 4: Create Your First Task

Tasks are perfect for multi-step workflows. Let's create a simple one:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Tasks">
    Click **"Tasks"** in the main navigation
  </Step>

  <Step title="New Task">
    Click **"New Task"** button
  </Step>

  <Step title="Name Your Task">
    Enter: "Meeting Summary and Follow-Up"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Steps">
    Create three steps:

    **Step 1: Get Meeting Info**
    ```
    @Microsoft 365 Apps show details of my last team meeting
    ```

    **Step 2: Summarize**
    ```
    Create a bullet-point summary of key discussion points
    and decisions from the meeting
    ```

    **Step 3: Generate Follow-Up**
    ```
    Draft a follow-up email to send to attendees with:
    - Summary of key decisions
    - Action items
    - Next meeting date
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Task">
    Click **"Run Task"** and watch AVA execute each step sequentially!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  After the task completes, you'll have a meeting summary and a drafted follow-up email!
</Check>

<Tip>
  Save successful tasks as templates by clicking **"Save as Template"** after completion
</Tip>

## Step 5: Try Knowledge Search

If your organization has set up Knowledge Search corpora, try this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Knowledge Search">
    Click **"Knowledge Search"** in main navigation
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select a Corpus">
    Click **"@ Connected Data"** and choose a corpus (e.g., "HR Policies")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask a Question">
    Try: "What's the remote work policy?"

    Or: "How much PTO do employees get?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Results">
    AVA searches documents and returns:
    - AI-generated answer
    - Source document citations
    - Relevant excerpts
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you don't see any corpora available, Knowledge Search hasn't been set up yet. Ask your administrator to create corpora from your SharePoint document libraries.
</Info>

## Step 6: Customize AVA

Make AVA work better for you with custom instructions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings">
    Click your profile icon (top right) → **"Settings"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Custom Instructions">
    Click **"Custom Instructions"** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Your Preferences">
    Example:
    ```
    I'm a sales manager in the enterprise segment.

    When showing opportunities:
    - Always include ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue)
    - Highlight deals over $100K
    - Show sales cycle length

    My working hours: 8am-6pm Pacific Time
    Format currency in USD with commas
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click **"Save"** - AVA will remember these preferences!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>

    **Yes!** AVA runs entirely within your organization's Azure tenant. Your data never leaves your environment. All processing happens in your tenant.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can others see my conversations?">
    **No**, unless you explicitly share them. Your chats are private by default.
  </Accordion>

    Data source connections (Salesforce, Jira, GitHub, etc.) are configured by your administrator. Contact your IT team to request additional integrations.
  </Accordion>

    Try:
    - Being more specific
    - Using @ mentions explicitly

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use AVA on mobile?">
    AVA is a web application that works in any modern browser, including mobile browsers. There's no dedicated mobile app yet.
