## Overview

### Your AI Super Assistant

AVA (AI Virtual Assistant) is an enterprise AI productivity platform that runs securely within your Azure tenant. Unlike external SaaS AI tools that just answer questions, **AVA takes action**—it's AI that works, not just talks.

Through Microsoft Graph API integration, AVA schedules your meetings, creates your tasks, shares your documents, sends your emails, and generates your presentations. It integrates seamlessly with your Microsoft 365 environment and business systems, using your existing Microsoft Entra identity to be your AI super assistant.

Think of AVA as your personal AI assistant that not only knows your calendar and can access your emails, but can also **modify your calendar**, **send those emails**, **share those documents**, and **create those tasks**—all while respecting your permissions and keeping your data secure within your Azure tenant.

## The AVA Difference

AVA solves a critical challenge: **How do you give your organization the power of AI while maintaining enterprise security and leveraging your existing Microsoft 365 investment?**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Runs Inside Your Azure Tenant">
    AVA is deployed as an Azure Enterprise Application within your own Azure environment. This means:
    - All data processing happens in your tenant
    - No data is sent to external SaaS providers
    - You maintain complete control over your information
    - Compliance requirements are easier to meet
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Uses Your Identity & Permissions">
    AVA leverages Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) for authentication:
    - Users sign in with their work accounts
    - AVA operates with delegated user permissions
    - It can only access what the user can access
    - No elevated privileges or broad access required
    - Perfect for zero-trust environments
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No Agent Creation Needed">
    Unlike other AI platforms that require creating separate agents for each integration:
    - AVA intelligently orchestrates all connected data sources
    - Single conversation can span multiple systems
    - Context is maintained across data sources
    - Natural language interface—just ask what you need
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enterprise-Grade Microsoft Integration">
    Built specifically for Microsoft 365 enterprises:
    - Native integration with Outlook, Teams, SharePoint, OneDrive
    - Works with your existing security policies
    - Supports your organizational structure
    - Familiar Microsoft-style authentication and UX
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Three Core Capabilities

### 1. AVA Chat

Your conversational AI interface for everything you need at work.

**What you can do:**
- Ask about your schedule: "What meetings do I have today?"
- Query your email: "Show me emails from Sarah about the project"
- Access files: "Find my Q4 budget spreadsheet"
- Pull Salesforce data: "What opportunities are closing this month?"
- Check Jira: "Show me my open issues"
- Query GitHub: "What pull requests are waiting for my review?"

**How it works:**
Use the `@` mention system to reference any connected data source. AVA understands context and can combine information from multiple sources in a single response.

**Example conversation:**
```
You: @Calendar what's on my schedule today?
AVA: You have 3 meetings: Team standup at 9am, Client call at 11am...

You: @Salesforce check status of opportunities discussed in that client call
AVA: Looking at your calendar, the 11am meeting is with Acme Corp.
     In Salesforce, you have 2 open opportunities with Acme Corp...

You: Draft an email to follow up
AVA: [Generates email draft using context from both systems]
```

### 2. AVA Tasks

Multi-step workflow automation with intelligent orchestration.

**What you can do:**
- Create multi-step processes with individual instructions
- Add documents from your OneDrive or SharePoint for context
- Use the SuperPrompt toggle for enhanced AI guidance
- Save successful workflows as templates
- Share task templates with your team

**Use cases:**
- Document analysis workflows
- Research and synthesis projects
- Content creation pipelines
- Data transformation tasks
- Report generation

**Example task:**
```
Task: Quarterly Business Review Preparation

Step 1: Review financial data
  - Pull Q4 financials from [uploaded Excel file]
  - Summarize key metrics

Step 2: Analyze pipeline
  - @Salesforce get all opportunities closing next quarter
  - Identify top 10 by value

Step 3: Create presentation
  - Generate PowerPoint with findings
  - Export to workspace
```

### 3. Knowledge Search

RAG-powered search across your SharePoint documents and knowledge bases.

**What you can do:**
- Search multiple document libraries simultaneously
- Query specific "corpora" (collections of related documents)
- Create custom corpora from SharePoint sites
- Configure automatic syncing
- Extract specific fields from documents

**Perfect for:**
- Contract management (search all contracts)
- HR policy questions (query employee handbooks)
- Technical documentation (find specific procedures)
- Customer service (search support documentation)
- Legal research (query legal documents)

**How it works:**
Instead of keyword search, Knowledge Search uses semantic understanding to find relevant information across all your documents, even if they don't contain your exact search terms.

**Example:**
```
Using: @Contracts Demo corpus

You: Find all contracts with early termination clauses

AVA: I found 12 contracts with early termination provisions:
     1. Acme Corp - 30 day notice required...
     2. TechStart LLC - 60 day notice with fee...
     [Provides summaries with source citations]
```
