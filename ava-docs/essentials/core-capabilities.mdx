## The Power of Microsoft Graph API

All these capabilities are possible because AVA integrates deeply with Microsoft Graph API—the unified API for Microsoft 365.

### What is Microsoft Graph API?

Microsoft Graph API provides a single endpoint to access data and intelligence across Microsoft 365, including:

- **Calendar & Events**: Create, update, manage meetings
- **Mail & Messages**: Read, send, organize email
- **Files & Documents**: Access, share, collaborate
- **Tasks & Planner**: Create, assign, track work
- **Teams & Channels**: Messages, meetings, collaboration
- **Users & Groups**: Directory, profiles, org structure
- **Security & Compliance**: Policies, alerts, audit

### Why This Matters

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Delegated Permissions">
    AVA acts on your behalf using **your** permissions. It can only do what you can do—no elevated access, no backdoors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Unified Experience">
    One conversation can span multiple Microsoft services seamlessly. Check calendar, send email, share file—all without switching contexts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Enterprise Security">
    All actions logged and audited. Respects your organization's security policies. Complies with data governance rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Endless Possibilities">
    As Microsoft adds capabilities to Graph API, AVA automatically gains new powers. The platform grows without AVA updates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
