# Glossary

Quick reference for AVA terminology, concepts, and features.

## A

### @ Mentions
Syntax for accessing connected data sources in AVA. Type `@` followed by the source name (e.g., `@Microsoft 365 Apps`, `@Web`, `@Salesforce`) to pull data from that system into your conversation.

### @Microsoft 365 Apps
Unified @ mention for accessing all Microsoft 365 services including Calendar, Mail, Files, OneDrive, SharePoint, Teams messages, and meetings. Replaces individual mentions like @Calendar, @Mail, @Files, etc.

### @Web
Real-time web search capability allowing AVA to find current information, news, and data beyond its training or your organizational data. Perfect for research, market intelligence, and up-to-date information.

### AI Super Assistant
AVA's positioning as more than a chatbot—an AI assistant that takes action across your Microsoft 365 environment through Microsoft Graph API integration.

### AI That Works™
AVA's core philosophy and tagline, emphasizing that AVA takes real action (scheduling meetings, creating tasks, sharing files) rather than just answering questions.

### AVA Chat
Conversational AI interface with @ mention access to connected data sources. Main feature for interacting with AVA and your business systems.

### AVA Tasks
Multi-step workflow automation feature allowing sequential execution of complex processes with intelligent orchestration.

### Azure AI Foundry
Microsoft's AI deployment platform, primary provider for AVA's AI models (GPT-5, DALL-E 3, etc.).

### Azure Container Apps
Serverless container service hosting AVA's backend Python services and MCP servers. Provides auto-scaling and high availability.

## C

### Conversation Sharing
Capability to share ongoing AVA conversations with teammates, including full context and history. Supports view-only and collaborative access levels.

### Copy to Notes
One-click feature to copy any AVA response to Workspace Notes for document building and organization.

### Corpus (plural: Corpora)
Collection of documents indexed for Knowledge Search. Created from SharePoint sites or document libraries for semantic search.

### Core Capabilities
Features available across all of AVA (Chat, Tasks, Knowledge Search): images, Microsoft actions, copy to notes, conversation sharing, exports, and PowerPoint generation.

### Custom Instructions
Personalized preferences and behavior settings that AVA remembers across all conversations and tasks.

## D

### DALL-E 3
OpenAI's image generation model available in AVA for creating visuals from text descriptions. Offers natural and vivid style options.

### Delegated Permissions
Security model where AVA operates with the authenticated user's permissions only—no elevated access or service accounts.

## E

### Embeddings
Vector representations of text used for semantic search in Knowledge Search. Generated by AI models and stored in pgVector.

### Entra ID
Microsoft's identity and access management platform (formerly Azure AD). Provides authentication and authorization for AVA.

### Export Capabilities
Feature set allowing generation of Office documents (PowerPoint, Word, Excel) from AVA conversations, tasks, and notes.

## G

### GPT-5 Series
Latest OpenAI models available in Azure including GPT-5, GPT-5 Pro, GPT-5 Codex, GPT-5 Chat, and GPT-5 Mini/Nano variants.

### GPT-image-1
Latest image generation model from OpenAI with improved quality and detail compared to DALL-E 3.

## K

### Knowledge Search
RAG-powered semantic search feature for querying SharePoint documents across multiple corpora simultaneously.

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
Standardized integration layer connecting AVA to enterprise applications like Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Jira, and GitHub.

### MCP Servers
Individual container apps running integration logic for each connected data source. Deployed separately for independent scaling.

### Microsoft Graph API
Unified API for Microsoft 365 services. Enables AVA to take actions like scheduling meetings, creating tasks, sharing files, and sending emails.

### Microsoft To Do
Task management application integrated with AVA. Tasks created by AVA appear in Microsoft To Do with due dates and assignments.

## P

### pgVector
PostgreSQL extension for efficient vector storage and similarity search. Used for Knowledge Search embeddings.

### PowerPoint Generation
Capability to create presentations from AVA conversations or notes. Version 3 coming with enhanced automation and intelligent layouts.

### Prompt Library
Repository of saved, reusable prompts that can be shared with individuals, teams, or the entire organization.

## R

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
AI technique combining semantic search with language generation. Used in Knowledge Search to provide accurate answers with source citations.

## S

### SuperPrompt
Enhanced AI guidance toggle in AVA Tasks that provides more detailed instructions and context for complex workflows.

## W

### Workspace
Right-side panel in AVA with three tabs: Search (find files/meetings), Notes (rich text editor), and File Viewer (view/edit Office documents).
