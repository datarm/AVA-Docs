## Overview

AVA Chat is your conversational AI interface that connects to all your enterprise data sources. Using simple `@` mentions, you can query Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Jira, GitHub, and other business systems—all within a single conversation.

AVA: [Shows 10 opportunities]

You: Which of these are closing this month?
AVA: [Filters the previous list - maintains context]

You: Send me details on the top 3
AVA: [Provides details on highest value opportunities from filtered list]
```

### Multi-Turn Dialogues

Have natural back-and-forth conversations:

```
You: I need to prepare for my client meeting tomorrow
AVA: I can help with that. Who are you meeting with?

You: Acme Corp
AVA: I found your 11am meeting with Sarah Johnson from Acme Corp.
     Would you like me to:
     1. Pull their Salesforce account history
     2. Find past email conversations
     3. Create a meeting agenda

You: All three
AVA: [Executes all three tasks and presents comprehensive prep document]

## Tips & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific with @ Mentions">
    Instead of: "Check my calendar"
    Better: "@Calendar what meetings do I have this week?"

    Explicitly using @ mentions helps AVA route your query to the right source faster.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Combine Sources for Better Context">
    Example: "@Calendar find my meeting with Acme Corp, then @Salesforce show their account history"

    AVA can connect information across systems for comprehensive answers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Follow-Up Questions">
    Don't start a new conversation for related questions. AVA maintains context.

    First: "Show me Q4 opportunities"
    Then: "Which ones are at risk?"
    Then: "Draft an email to the account owners"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Leverage Custom Instructions">
    Set up custom instructions (in settings) for consistent behavior:
    - Your role and preferences
    - How you want data formatted
    - Your working hours and timezone
    - Specific terminology your team uses
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Save Common Queries as Prompts">
    If you ask the same question regularly, save it in the Prompt Library:
    - "Weekly pipeline review"
    - "Sprint status summary"
    - "Email inbox triage"

    Reuse prompts to save time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Data Access">
    **Q: What data can AVA access?**
    A: Only data you can access. AVA uses your delegated permissions—if you can't see a file in SharePoint, AVA can't either.

    **Q: Is my data sent to OpenAI/Anthropic?**
    A: Your organizational data stays in your Azure tenant. Only the AI-generated responses come from external providers.

    **Q: Can AVA modify my data?**
    A: Only if you explicitly ask (e.g., "Update this Salesforce record"). All modifications are logged.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Performance">
    **Q: How fast are responses?**
    A: Typically 2-10 seconds depending on:
    - Model selected (GPT-5 Nano/Mini, Flash, Haiku models faster than GPT-5 Pro/Opus models)
    - Data source query complexity
    - Amount of data to process

    **Q: Can I use AVA offline?**
    A: No, AVA requires internet connection to access connected data sources and AI models.

    **Q: Is there a message limit?**
    A: No hard limit, but very long conversations may hit model context limits (128K-1M tokens depending on model). Start a new session if needed.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Security">
    **Q: Who can see my conversations?**
    A: Only you, unless you explicitly share a session.

    **Q: Are conversations logged?**
    A: Yes, for audit and compliance purposes via Application Insights.

    **Q: Can admins see my chats?**
    A: Admins can access audit logs showing usage patterns, but not conversation content unless required for security/compliance investigation.
