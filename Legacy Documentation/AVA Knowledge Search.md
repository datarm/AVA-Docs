# AVA Knowledge Search

Knowledge Search in AVA is a special type of chat that allows you to ask specific questions of your business documents. This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach allows you to ask natural language questions of a large number of documents.

Your documents are managed in SharePoint and are separated into specific Knowledge Bases based on departments (such as HR or Marketing) or document type (such as resumes or past contracts). This helps AVA answer your questions with specific data references and citations from your documents.

## General Usage Guide

Welcome to the demonstration of AVA's Knowledge Search! This tutorial will show you how to utilize Knowledge Search for comparing resumes and pinpointing the key distinctions between two candidates. This tool is a unique chat feature that enables you to pose specific queries about your business documents. This Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method permits the asking of natural language questions across a vast array of documents.

### 5. Embedded Files

Once you select your source, AVA's Workspace will display an "Embedded Files" tab containing files relevant to each specific source. These files, supplied by your organization, will always be pertinent when posing questions to AVA.

### 6. Create your Query

For instance, if you select the "Resume" source, you can request AVA to analyze two embedded resumes simply by mentioning them in your query. Formulate a query using these embedded files and submit it when you are prepared.

### 7. Review Analysis

Once submitted, AVA will generate an output based on your query. For this example, AVA showed qualifications and pros and cons for each candidate.

This tutorial has shown you how to utilize Knowledge Search for comparing resumes and pinpointing the key distinctions between two candidates. This tool is a unique chat feature that enables you to pose specific queries about your business documents.

## **Selecting a Knowledge Base**

Before you start a Knowledge Search, you will need to select a Knowledge Base. You will see specific Knowledge Bases based on your role and credentials. It is possible that other users of AVA will have a different list of Knowledge Bases available. to them depending on their role.

## Using the Embedded File Viewer

Documents that are available in knowledge search go through a process called “embedding” to make them available in AVA.

## **Citations in Knowledge Bases**

If your question returns a response from documents in your Knowledge Base, AVA will respond with a citation at the end of her response. You can click the link to open the cited document in the file viewer inside AVA.

## **Saving and Sharing with Workspaces**

By default, AVA saves all your work to your session history, but there are more robust ways to interact with the content AVA helps you create. Rather than scrolling back through your chat or the session history, or copying AVA's answers to another app, you can save your work in AVA Workspaces. From here, you can continue editing and share your Chat and Workspace with other members of your team.

Hover over any chat message in AVA, and you will see a "Copy" icon. This will load the content of that Chat message to your clipboard to paste into your Workspace. From there, you can keep editing and formatting, as well as [share your work with your team](https://datarm.ai/help-center-articles/sharing-in-ava).

## **Managing Knowledge Bases**

Knowledge Bases are managed through SharePoint. At this time, you must contact your system administrator or AVA admin to have them work with DataRM to set up new Knowledge Bases.
