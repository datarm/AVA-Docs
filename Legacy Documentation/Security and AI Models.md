# Security and AI Models

## Security

AVA is built on Azure OpenAI, a service provided by Microsoft that offers access to a vast library of advanced language models. These models can be utilized through Azure's robust and scalable cloud platform. As AVA is built on Azure OpenAI, your data—used for input or output—remains secure within your company. This applies to data from:

- Prompting
- Office 365 files
- Your own personal files
